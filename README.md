# 🚀 Network Sniffer - CodeAlpha Internship Project

Welcome to my **Network Sniffer** project! 🛡️ This project is part of my internship with **@CodeAlpha**. The goal is to capture and analyze network traffic, enhancing my understanding of data flow and packet structures. 🛡⚖️

## 🔧 Project Overview
This Python-based network sniffer listens to the network interface, captures packets, and displays their details. It's a lightweight tool designed to inspect and log network activity for educational and analysis purposes.

### 📖 Features
- Real-time packet capturing ⏳
- Protocol filtering (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) 🔄
- Detailed packet analysis 📊
- Simple and clean code 🔧

### 🚀 Why Build This?
- To learn about network protocols and packet structures 📂
- Understand how data is transmitted across networks 🌐
- Practice Python programming and socket usage 🤖

## 💪 Requirements and How to Run
- Python 3.x 💻
- `scapy` library (for packet crafting and analysis)
- Administrator/root privileges (for capturing packets) 🤐

Install dependencies, clone the repository, and run the sniffer:
```bash
pip install scapy
sudo python Sniffer.py
